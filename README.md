# _printf

The project, _printf is the first major project that is built in the holberton school, is about building a function as similar as possible to the original function present in the standard library of programming language C, this is a challenge of some difficulty since the original function behaves in very specific ways in certain cases.

This project was built by Alejandro LÃ³pez and Juan Marcos Cabezas

# Features
- The main function uses structures to call the function corresponding to the case, this allows greater code scalability.
- As in the original printf, the function has a buffer that stores and prints the output strings every 1024 bytes.
- Just like the original printf, the returns of our function are the number of characters printed, when the input is incorrect the return is error -1

# Tasks
## Task 0

| Specifier | Function name                    |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------:|
| %c      | `print_char()`       |
| %s   | `print_string()`     |
| %%   | `print_percen()`     |

## %c

- %c is about being able to print the individual characters that were passed as a parameter to the function.

### Test Cases
- [x] _printf("%c", NULL);
- [x] _printf("%c", 'A');
- [x] _printf("%c", 'A');

## %s

- %s is about being able to print strings, which are received as parameters to eh function.


### Test Cases
- [x] _printf("%s", "holberton");
- [x] _printf("%ss", "holberton");
- [x] _printf("%s", "");
- [x] _printf("%s");


## %%

- %% is about being able to print the the char % because being the indefinifier of printf specifiers could generate conflicts at the time of printing.

### Test Cases

- [x] _printf("%%");

## Task 1

| Specifier | Function name                    |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------:|
| %d   | `print_d()`       |
| %i   | `print_i()`     |

## %d

- %d is about being able to print the integers that can be handled in the int variable, the smallest number is -2147483648 and the max is 2147483647

### Test Cases
- [x] _printf("%d",-2147483648);
- [x] _printf("%d", 2147483647);


## %i

- %i is about being able to print the integers that can be handled in the int variable, the smallest number is -2147483648 and the max is 2147483647


### Test Cases
- [x] _printf("%i",-2147483648);
- [x] _printf("%i", 2147483647);
